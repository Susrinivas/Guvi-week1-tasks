1. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 HTTP version history?

A. HTTP1.1 : Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee  in 1989 & came to existence in 1997, since then it created reveloution in the Internet world, Http1.1 is used to establish connection between client machine & server machine. this is a client-server architecture. Http1.1 uses plaint text format requests 
To establish connection between client & server, client sends a request in plain text format to server & server responds with response

Below is an exmaple on how client request will look like

Ex: 
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com

HTTP 1.1 has several issues like speed, delay in response from resouce, high latency etc
Http2 overcomes all this issues & is the leader of web right now ( without this we cannot surf the web or internet)

Http2 uses binary framing layer unlike plain text format which greatly helped to cope up the existing issues with Http1.1

Delivery models: Http 1.1 uses plain text format
                 Http2 uses binary framing 

Multiplexing : Http1.1 sends requests & responses seperately in single TCP connection which is likely proned to errors & need high bandwidth 
               Http2 uses multiplexing where within the single connection there are multiple streams of data. each stream consists of multiple messages in the                request/response format.finally, each of these messages split into smaller units called frames

Stream prioritisation: As you know now, the binary framing layer organizes messages into parallel streams of data. When a client sends concurrent requests to a server, it can prioritize the responses it is requesting by assigning a weight between 1 and 256 to each stream. The higher number indicates higher priority. 

Buffer Overflow: Http1.1 uses transport layer for buffer overflow in which for single TCP connection there is single buffer allocated for client & server which in most causes buffer oveflow issue
Http2 uses Application layer protocol for buffer overflow to overcome these problems

HTTP version history:

HTTP/0.9 — The One-line Protocol
 Initial version of HTTP — a simple client-server, request-response, telenet-friendly protocol
 Request nature: single-line (method + path for requested document)
 Methods supported: GET only
 Response type: hypertext only
 Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response
 No HTTP headers (cannot transfer other content type files), No status/error codes, No URLs

HTTP/1.0 — Building extensibility
    Browser-friendly protocol
    Provided header fields including rich metadata about both request and response (HTTP version number, status code, content type)
    Response: not limited to hypertext (Content-Type header provided ability to transmit files other than plain HTML files — e.g. scripts, stylesheets, media)
    Methods supported: GET , HEAD , POST
    Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response

HTTP/1.1 — The standardized protocol
   This is the HTTP version currently in common use.
   Introduced critical performance optimizations and feature enhancements — persistent and pipelined connections, chunked transfers, compression/decompression, content                                                                             negotiations, virtual hosting (a server with a single IP Address hosting multiple domains),                                                                             faster response and great bandwidth savings by adding cache support.
   Methods supported: GET , HEAD , POST , PUT , DELETE , TRACE , OPTIONS
   Connection nature: long-lived

Http/2 : solved Buffer overflow issues
         introduced multiplexing
         Stream prioritisation
         binary framing
